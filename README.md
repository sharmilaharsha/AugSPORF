Leveraging Memory Forensic Features for Explainable Obfuscated  Malware Detection with Isolated Family Distinction Paradigm

In the IoT edge era, inevitable and ubiquitous presence of internet is opening door for numerous cyberattacks. Obfuscated malware is adding the layers of difficulty to detect complex modern cyber attacks by evading AI enabled Next-Generation Anti-Virus(NGAV) scanners and breaching digital privacy. In this paper we propose ``Augmented Sparse Projection Oblique Random Forest(AugSPORF)", an Explainable sparse projections based Oblique Random Forest with Isolated Family Distinction(IFD) Paradigm to detect multiple obfuscated malware belonging to Spyware, Ransomware, and Trojan families effectively. Firstly, we handle the huge dimension of memory forensic features with sparse random projections. Next, we perform feature importance aware training with Oblique Random Forest(ORF) to learn inherent behavioral features of malware families by isolating the target family to distinguish other families.	Further the scalability of the model is assessed by increasing number of malware families. To offer an insightful conclusion on the predictions, an Interpretable Machine Learning(IML) layer is interleaved to generate a report of explanations, also enhancing the interpretability of the model. The proposed approach yields an average accuracy of 96.74%, 96.42%, and 97.3% in detecting subfamilies of Spyware, Ransomware, and Trojan respectively. Improved accuracy is also demonstrated by benchmarking the performance of AugSPORF on UCI repository datasets.
